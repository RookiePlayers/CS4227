Currently set up so that:
The accepted logins are read from logins.txt in Resources file
Current user is written to file currentuser.txt in Resources
Both of the above are shown in the png CS4227FileLocations

Otherwise, just add both packages to project, edit main to match png CS4227Main and SurvivalBoard to match relevant png

Class Trap was moved to Adapter package for cohesion
